      <h1>In Spite of Homeowner Opposition, NYC's Housing Lien Program May Be Renwed</h1>

      <p class="flexbox1">Picture this: It's the mid-90s in New York City. It's the middle of the Guiliani era and the city is looking to pad its budget after a few decades of white flight, social unrest and falling tax revenues. There are thousands
        of property owners who have become delinquent on their taxes and water bills in recent years. Under previous administrations, if a property owner fell behind on their tax obligations, the city could put a lien on their property and eventually
        foreclose on
        it. But that leaves the city holding the bag if something goes wrong with their newly acquired building (broken plumbing, foundational issues, tenants left disgruntled by neglected repairs). So what do you do? If you're Rudy Guiliani, you
        want to offload the responsiblities
        associated this shaky real estate portfolio while also collecting some money off of it to replace what was lost to unpaid taxes. Enter the private trust. </p>
      <p class="flexbox1"> In 1996, the city began selling its housing debt to a private trust made up of individual investors, which took on the financial burdens of the foreclosure process. The trust tacked interest rates as high as 18% and high
        fees onto the back taxes ahead of the foreclosure sale. Upon sale, the investors would recoup their profits and the city would receive the remainder without having to handle the paperwork involved.</p>

      <p class="flexbox1"> Below are maps comparing NYC's median income by neighborhood/community district and where home liens sales are concentrated. The relationship between home lien sales and a community district's median income are related, but
        not an exact inverse. While there is a correlation between high income community districts and a lower number of home lien sales -- particularly in lower Manhattan and western Brooklyn -- the heaviest concentration of home lien sales for 2019
        has been happening in parts of Brooklyn and Queens that are on the lower and middle sections of their boroughs' income distribution. (Grayed out areas are non-residential areas of the city such as parks, cemeteries and airports.)</p>

    <div>
      <p class="flexbox1">The lien sale trust program has been renewed by City Council and subsequent mayoral administrations for the last 20 years, but has recently come under renewed scrutiny as building owners in East New York, Brownsville and
        other lower- and middle-income majority Black and brown neighborhoods fight for relief after a year of financial losses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This year's lien sales have been delayed due to the pandemic (the one scheduled
        for
        July didn't happen until October), and City Council has
        debated doing away with the process completely. The program is set to expire at the end of this year, but according to THE CITY(1), the council is likely to renew it.</p>
